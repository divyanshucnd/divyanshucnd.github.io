							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>
							<dl>
								<dt><u>What and when?</u></dt>
								<dd>IT is a dynamic and everlasting field, the more you get into it, the more you discover. I enjoy keeping up with the latest advances in the broad and ever-changing field of information technology. My main interest in IT is computer programming, app development and web designing as each of them rely on creativity and problem-solving skills. IT gives me a pleasure to solve the problems in a creative manner.
									My interest in computer began when my parents gifted me a personal computer on my 12th birthday. At that time, computer was just a toy and entertainment device for me. With the passage of time, my interest was directed towards its working and how it manages and tranfers huge data in a wireless medium in a matter of seconds. I have a best friend, named Varun, he belongs to electronics and communication field. He is a techie, and shares me almost every knowledge and updates me with the news in the field of technology. Being with him, he made me more aware about the world of technology. He has a great role in my life that sparked my interest.

								<dt><u>What do I expect to learn?</u></dt>
								<dd>During my studies, I expect to equip myself with the skills to make a living as I solve, support, troubleshoot and design, everything from web sites to applications to programming networks, in organisations ranging from business and government to schools, healthcare and more. On completing my graduation, I expect to come up with a good command of at east two programming languages, especially C++, Java and Python. Opting business and management as a minor subject, I would like to gain not only computer and programming skills but also that of business and management skills.
									I expect to gain a combination of knowledge and practical expertise to influence an organisation’s technology infrastructure and the clients who use IT. As software and artificial intelligence has a great scope in future, so I would like to be trained myself in both of these fields with a knowledge of data security and cloud computing as well. Theoretical knowledge has no significance without its practical experince, therefore, I expect to broaden my skills and experience by working with industry.

							<h2>Project ideas</h2>
							<p>After acquiring proper theoritical and practical knowledge, I would like to devolop a smartphone app that could help people to gain any knowledge or updates them on any topic in a matter or seconds using an artificial intelligeence software. Consumers just need to ask the app and app will answer their questions in seconds. Consumers can ask the app to search any data from web or update them with the current news or they can ask to set reminders, etc. The app could work as a virtual personal assistant  which will response only to it's  own consumer by detacting his/her voice commands. Thia assistant can engage in two-way conversation in any of the preferred language of the consumer. </p>
							<p> In this fast-paced world of technology, virtual personal assistants are having a huge monent. Statistics reveal that half of the UK workforce will want to work remotely by 2020. Around 60.5 million people in the US alone constantly use voice-enabled digital assistants. From the side of entrepreneur or business or any indivudual, who wouldn't want a totally-efficient, totally-affordable employee who self-manages from anywhere that doesn't cost a thing? Virtual assistant apps manage tasks at a lightening speed.</p>

							<p>For the success of such applications, it needs to be handy and meet the requirements of its users. They shold look interesting with a good user-centred design. The use of virtual assistant will not be limited to a single community, so it will be able to respond to the user's klanguuage of command. It will have a voice or facial recognition artificial intelligence system and will be unlock by its user's voice and face detection. Consumers can use it to set remainders, surf internet, navigate, check weather forecast, update themselves with news, etc.
								Not only this, it will help them to control other smart devices like smart lights, fans, television, etc. It can prove to be a source of recreation as well as it will be able to have a two-way conversation with its users, it can play music or tell a joke. It will help consumers to managge time because of its high speed response technology. The application will start by welcoming its user.</p>

							<p>Voice assistants are very well a part of our lives today but there are many hurdles to create such application. The ability to recognize and manage the voice-controlled communication and devices at large has been a constant bottleneck. Secondly, thhese technologies can't go beyond single-threaded conversations and into multi-threaded conversations with even basic context. All these obstacles need to be tackled with the passage of time with proper skills and knowledge. Some basic skills required to develop such applications is an expertise knowledge of at least one or two progrmming language with an idea of user experience.
								Before working on such projects, a survey needs to be conducted to get information of users needs and how they want their assistants to work for them. During the development of this application, privacy of users has be considered as many users feel that such applications spy on them and their work.</p>
							<p>As an entrepreneur, first we need to find a source of funds or company that will invest on such projects. The artiicial intelligence led future is here now, I will try to develop an advance version of such artifical intelligence. This application can be used in any field for any kind of job, from speaking a recipe, to book a cab, to get an article, etc. This artificial assistant will have speech-to-text and text-to-speech software.</p>
							<p>If the project is successful, this will effictively reduce the work and time load for everyone as much of the task will be done by the assistant in just one command. Now, users can use that saved time on other activities or simply take a peaceful breath from their busy schedule. Even after its success, surveys will be conducted to monitor users need and experience for its update. This kind of arificial intelligence will be very helful for people of all age-groups be it students, or old-age. Such technologies will take development to a next level.
