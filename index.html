							<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
							<p>
							<dl>
								<dt><u>What and when?</u></dt>
								<dd>IT is a dynamic and everlasting field, the more you get into it, the more you discover. I enjoy keeping up with the latest advances in the broad and ever-changing field of information technology. My main interest in IT is computer programming and web designing as both of them rely on creativity and problem-solving skills. IT gives me a pleasure to solve the problems in a creative manner.
									My interest in computer began when my parents gifted me a personal computer on my 12th birthday. At that time, computer was just a toy and entertainment device for me. With the passage of time, my interest was directed towards its working and how it manages and tranfers huge data in a wireless medium in a matter of seconds. I have a best friend, named Varun, he belongs to electronics and communication field. He is a techie, and shares me almost every knowledge and updates me with the news in the field of technology. Being with him, he made me more aware about the world of technology. He has a great role in my life that sparked my interest.

								<dt><u>What do I expect to learn?</u></dt>
								<dd>During my studies, I expect to equip myself with the skills to make a living as I solve, support, troubleshoot and design, everything from web sites to applications to programming networks, in organisations ranging from business and government to schools, healthcare and more. On completing my graduation, I expect to come up with a good command of at east two programming languages, especially C++, Java and Python. Opting business and management as a minor subject, I would like to gain not only computer and programming skills but also that of business and management skills.
									I expect to gain a combination of knowledge and practical expertise to influence an organisation’s technology infrastructure and the clients who use IT. As software and artificial intelligence has a great scope in future, so I would like to be trained myself in both of these fields with a knowledge of data security and cloud computing as well. Theoretical knowledge has no significance without its practical experince, therefore, I expect to broaden my skills and experience by working with industry.
									I would like to develop some apps during my studies and project work. Creating websites will give the opportunity to showcase my coding skills and creativity. In a nutshell, I expect to come up with the key abilities such as analysis, effective communication, ethical valuing, and problem solving.
